## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Charts Not Loading
Ensure Chart.js is loaded from CDN or install locally:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
```

### Styles Not Applying
Check that both CSS files are properly linked:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/main.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/demo.css">
```

### JavaScript Errors
Open browser developer tools (F12) to see console errors. Most issues are due to missing files or incorrect paths.

## 📞 Support

For demo-related questions or customization needs:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify all files are properly linked
